# SpriteGridV1
This is the first working version of this Webapp I have made. Whenever I make a game or another Webapp that will use sprites for the images, and I make those sprites using arrays for grids, this will help me to not just edit the numbers manually in the array. A huge timesaver. This only took me a few hours to make. Expect a changelog for version 2.
